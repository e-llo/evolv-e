## Genetic Algorithm in Javascript

* Web application that aims at **simulating evolution** by natural selection using genetic algorithms in Javascript. 

## 📖How does it work?
It is a 2D virtual environment in which organisms with randomly generated genes evolve over the generations. The user has the ability to alter some of the properties that rule the environment in order to analyse how each gene (attribute) is affected. Each object - organism - may or may not conceive new descendents, which will carry their father's attributes values with themselves, but with a slight chance for each of the genes of undergoing a mutation.

## 🧰Tools
The interface used for the simulation is primarily HTML Canvas. However, alongside it there's a dashboard containing interactive graphics which showcase the frequency of each gene in the population over time.

## ⁉️Why?
Our goal is to demonstrate how natural selection enables complex populations and behaviors to spontaneously emerge even in rigid environments ruled by simplistic laws.
